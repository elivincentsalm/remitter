# remitter: Automating Covert and Resilient C2 Infrastructure Deployments
Remitter is a web GUI application which assists with automating deployments of covert C2 infrastructure. Remitter is designed to be extremely easy to configure for teams lacking domain-knowledge and includes many considerations for teams with high compliance/audit requirements.

## Rationale
The above system diagram shows the "maximal" C2 infrastructure that can be created with Remitter. Maximal, meaning meant to display the full capabilities and complexity of Remitter. Components can be removed as desired in configuration settings to reduce complexity, cost, and/or realism. Below contains the rationale for each component in the above system diagram. 

### Victim Network
Remitter is not an implant generation framework, though it is designed to be flexible to accomodate handing

### Internet, Mesh Overlay VPN

#### Redirector Layer

#### Laundry Layer

### Protected Operational Network

#### Fingerprint/Cover Server

#### Credential Capture Server

#### Operations Management Center
